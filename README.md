cassertion
==========

Simple C test framework

In the very thin layer between supersimple and _just what you want_ C unit
test framework is CASSERTION.

* You can very easily set which of your test suites will run.
* All assertions are clearly logged in a log file.
* You can measure time of testing operations very easily.
* You can have any structure of your test suites.

Go to the examples direcotry and run:
